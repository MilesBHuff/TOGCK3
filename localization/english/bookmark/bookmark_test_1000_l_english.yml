 bm_1000_test:0 "The Fifth Era"
 bm_1000_test_desc:1 "The Fifth Age is a time of amazing strides for the human race, granting many humans dominance throughout central Gielinor largely due to the discovery of runes at the end of the Fourth Age. Positive advances in humanity's lifestyle included military, technological, theological, philosophical, political, and economic strides. The Fifth Age, as a result, has been referred to by some as the ''Age of Humans''."
